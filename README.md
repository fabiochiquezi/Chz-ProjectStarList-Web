# 🤙 Star List

[![Website](https://img.shields.io/website?style=flat-square&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffabiochiquezi.github.io%2F)](https://starlist.chiquezi.com/)

It's a WebApp to build your own list of movies, games and books you are doing, have done or will do.

My motivation to build this App comes from the experience of being on the Discord platform talking to people to practice English and then, always talking about what kind of books, movies, series or games they like.

So I thought I'd build a place, where I can share it via a link (on my discord profile, for example) and everyone who visits will have my list.

Also, it will help a lot to organize everything I'm doing.
